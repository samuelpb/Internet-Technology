# Internet-Technology
My code from Rutgers' Internet Technology course

Asst1:
    In Asst1, we were tasked to implement a GO-Back-N flow control protocol over a UDP internet socket. This works for
    a signle connection from one client to a server, and the TCP three-way handshake set up is used to begin the connection.
