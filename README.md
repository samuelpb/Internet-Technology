# Internet-Technology
My code from Rutgers' Internet Technology course

Asst1:
    In Asst1, we were tasked to implement a GO-Back-N flow control protocol over a UDP internet socket. This works for
    a single connection from one client to a server, and the TCP three-way handshake set up is used to begin the connection.
    
Asst2:
    In Asst2, we were tasked to elaborate on Asst1 by adding Encryption using nacl public and private keys. To do this, I 
    used the answers provided for part 1 to make my ocde more efficient, and then added encryprion on top.
